It is best to wait until you are older and in a better position to make informed decisions about sex.  \r\n\r\nFor people who choose to have sex, these are the best ways to protect yourself from HIV and other STIs:\r\n\r\n2.\tUse a latex condom every time you have sex.\r\n3.\tBe faithful to one uninfected partner who is also faithful to you.\r\n4.\tDo not do drugs or abuse alcohol. These substances make it difficult for you to make smart decisions that can protect you from becoming infected.\r\n\r\n**Can I tell if someone has HIV?**\r\n\r\nA person who is infected with HIV does not often show symptoms. There is no way of telling that someone is infected unless you take a HIV test.\r\n\r\n**Where can I get a HIV test?**\r\n\r\nYou can get a HIV test at any private doctor, health centre or hospital.",
