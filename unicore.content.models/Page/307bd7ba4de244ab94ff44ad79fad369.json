  "content": "\u2022\tThe best way of preventing HIV is to abstain from or delay sex.  If you are an adolescent, make achieving your goals your top priority.  It is best to wait until you are older and in a better position to make informed decisions about sex.  \r\n\u2022\tFor people who choose to have sex, pregnancy can be prevented by using a latex condom everytime you have sex or by using a contraceptive.  It is best to use both a condom and a contraceptive, since contraceptives do not prevent sexually transmitted infections.  There are several types of contraceptives.\r\n\u2022\tCall the Marge Roper helpline for more information about preventing pregnancy: 968-1619 or 968-1634.\r\n\r\n",
